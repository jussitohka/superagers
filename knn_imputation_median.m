% Missing data imputation by k nearest neighbours or median
% requires statistics and machine learning toolbox (nanmean,nanstd,nanmedian)
% data is nsubj times nvar data matrix
% subjidx are the indexes of subjects that can be used for imputation (aka
% training set)
% varidx are the indexes of variables that can be used for imputation
% k is the number of nearest neighbours, give 0 if median
